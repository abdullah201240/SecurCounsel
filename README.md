2. **DoS/DDoS Attack Mitigation:**
   Employing sophisticated mechanisms to detect and mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring uninterrupted system availability.

3. **Two-Step Verification:**
   Enhancing user authentication with the implementation of two-step verification, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.

4. **Access Controls:**
   Defining and enforcing access controls to regulate user permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to specific system functionalities.

5. **Network Firewalls:**
   Utilizing robust network firewalls to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.

6. **Data Backups:**
   Implementing a resilient data backup strategy to safeguard critical information and ensure data recovery in case of system failures or data loss incidents.

7. **Data Encryption:**
   Employing state-of-the-art encryption techniques to protect sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

8. **Security Logging and Monitoring:**
   Establishing a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track user activities and detect suspicious behavior in real-time.

9. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
   Incorporating an Intrusion Detection System to promptly identify and respond to potential security breaches or malicious activities.

10. **Proprietary Algorithms for Authentication:**
